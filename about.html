      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a web developer planning to be versant with creating web applications,corporate
        websites and landing pages.I live in Nairobi,
        Kenya. I spend my days with my hands in many different
        areas of web development trying out back end programming (PHP,Python,JavaScript,Bootstrap)
        to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript),user experience and visual design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m extremely passionate about web development and design in all it’s forms and
        helping peers improve on there web skills. I developed my programming skills at
        JKUAT university where i got to learn various techniques in becoming a better programmer.
        I've been an intern at MRM (Mabati rolling Mills) where i did technical stuff like networking
        software and OS installations. My interest in programming grew while i was at the university,
        programming languages like java and php was a challange (still is) and that's why i opted to
        join Moringa Schools to expertise myself and upgrade my coding skills for the few months that
        i'll be here.<br><br>
        Aside from web development, I enjoy spending my time with family and friends,
        taking photos, playing & watching sports (basketball,football,tabletennis to name a few).</p>
